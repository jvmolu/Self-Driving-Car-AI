# NEAT Self-Driving Car AI 🚗💨

Welcome to our cutting-edge Self-Driving Car AI repository powered by NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) library! 🤖🔥

## Overview
Our project harnesses the power of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Neural Networks to create an autonomous driving system. NEAT's dynamic structure allows our AI to evolve and adapt its neural network architecture for optimal performance on various driving tasks.

## Features
**NEAT Integration:** Utilizes NEAT to evolve neural network structures, enabling adaptive learning and behavior.

**Realistic Simulation:** Experience a realistic driving environment with intuitive controls and challenging scenarios.

**Genetic Algorithms:** Leverages GA to evolve neural network parameters, optimizing driving strategies and decision-making.

**Visual Insights:** Visualize AI's decision-making process through intuitive graphical interfaces.

## Future Directions
Integration with real-world hardware for physical self-driving car experiments.

Enhancements in simulation realism and environment diversity by adding more sensors to the car neural network.

Incorporation of advanced neural network architectures for improved performance.
